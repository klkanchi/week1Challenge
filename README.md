# Week1- Kickstarting with Excel Challenge

## Overview of Project:
Main objective of the project is to help Lousie to determine the important factors that play a role in success of the crowd funding campaign she is planning.By looking at campaigns from start to finish we can help Louise get an idea to start her own campaign called Fever. 

### Purpose


## Analysis and Challenges:
Using `Kickstarter` dataset want to visualize campaign outcomes based on launch dates and funding goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

Louise is interested in starting a campaign for theater, a subcategory column is created to subset the parent category. Pivot table and pivot charts are used to analyze the data and create the visualization. Parent category is filtered on theater.A line chart `Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png` created.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Had some difficulty understanding the dataset and the various attributes. Little bit morr introduction to the dataset would be more helpful to solve the assignment.

## Results:

- What are the two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes Based on Launch Date?
When the launch date is in May, June and July the success rate increased than the other months. The launch date from April to May increased drastically  the     success of the theater outcomes 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
As the goal amount increased the percent success decreased gradually but when the goal is between 35,000 to 45,000 the percent sucess increaded and the number   failed decreased.

- what are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Pie charts can be created for the Outcomes based on Goals. The margins for the Goal range can be subdivided to smaller ranges than 5000.
